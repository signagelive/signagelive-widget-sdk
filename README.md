# Signagelive Widget SDK Methods
This repository provides example widgets for each of the methods available in the Signagelive Widget SDK.

To test a widget in Signagelive:
1. Zip up all of the files and folders within one of the subfolders (e.g. sendReadyToDisplay), including the index.html and config.xml. These files must be available in the root of the folder structure.
2. Change the File Extension to .wgt
3. Upload to Signagelive
4. Add to a playlist 
6. When double-clicking the asset in a playlist, if there are preferences available then these can be changed
7. Save the playlist
8. Publish the playlist to your Signagelive Player
9. If your player supports the widget SDK method then it will complete the required functionality based on the information provided on the build.signagelive.com site.
